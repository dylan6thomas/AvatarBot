# Avatar Script Generation

This is a small project I worked on a few years ago. The goal was to create a model that could generate new scripts for Avatar: The Last Airbender episodes. Using all of the scripts for the entire series, trained a GRU model to generate new text given a starting seed. While results were not amazing, it was pretty cool to see what could be done. This was my first taste of NLP, before ChatGPT was even a thing. Now, transformers could probably create something way more advanced, especially using a pre-trained model.
